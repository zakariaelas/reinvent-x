# Reinvent-X

As developers, reusing other people's code is part of our job. We are usually only exposed an interface or API to consume. This definitely improves our productivity and allows us to invest our efforts on the business logic and be pragmatic. However, I feel a bit of frustration when things start to feel like "magic". The more abstract the APIs are, the more intrigued and fascinated I become. I often find myself googling "how does x work under the hood ?". This repository is an attempt to document my findings as well as an opportunity for me to write simple implementations of different libraries/frameworks. These implementations are solely for **educational purposes** and will be kept simple enough to satisfy my intrigue. I do not advise using these in any production environment whatsoever.

## Implementations

Following is the list of implementations in this repository:
